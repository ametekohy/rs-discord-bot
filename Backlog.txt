TO DO:
-Command to change name in memberslist
-Remove member(s) from memberslist.txt
-Look into reading google docs via google docs API (https://developers.google.com/docs/api/quickstart/nodejs)

ISSUES:
-!hs command breaks when using a name that includes a spacebar. Spacebars converts in to a comma.

SUGGESTIONS:
-Add a !clanjoindate (google docs)
-Change roles for members based on killcount (raids kc channel) & send message in admin channel to update the moderators.
-link discord userid to runscape name. (what if multiple accounts?)
